Ppap is a postal address parser written in PHP. Its goal is to take a raw address string and break it down into its basic components such as way name, number, town and zip code. It supports multiple locales and is being written with extensibility in mind.

This project is currently WIP. The initial version will feature a parser for Spanish addresses.
